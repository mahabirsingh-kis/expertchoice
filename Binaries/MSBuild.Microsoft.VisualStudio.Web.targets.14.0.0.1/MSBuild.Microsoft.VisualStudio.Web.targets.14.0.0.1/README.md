# MSBuild.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.targets

MSBuild targets for Web and WebApplications that come with Visual Studio. Useful for build servers that do not have Visual Studio installed.

Includes `.targets` files from Visual Studio 2015 that can be found in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\{Web,WebApplications}` directories.
