The blue vertical line indicates the current %%likelihood%% of the selected %%objective%%. The intersections of the blue line with the %%alternative%% lines/curves represent the %%likelihoods%% of the %%alternatives%%. You can drag the blue line to see how the %%alternative%% %%likelihoods%% (intersections) would change if the %%likelihood%% of the case were become to be more or less likely.
