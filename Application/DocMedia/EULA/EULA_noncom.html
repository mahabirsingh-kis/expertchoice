<p align="JUSTIFY"><span>You acknowledge and agree that the Software and all information emanating from the Software and Licensor’s business in any form are valuable trade secrets of Licensor and "Confidential Information." You agree that you will not, during or after the term of this Agreement, permit the duplication, use, or disclosure of any such Confidential Information to any person including third parties (other than your employees, agents or representatives), unless such duplication, use or disclosure is specifically authorized by Licensor in writing prior to any disclosure.</span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span>You shall use reasonable diligence, and in no event less than that degree of care that you use in respect to your own confidential information of like nature, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or reproduction of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that this Agreement permits the copying of Confidential Information, all such copies shall bear the same confidentiality notices, legends, and intellectual property rights designations that appear in the original versions and party shall keep detailed records of the location of all Confidential Information.</span></p>
<h1>24. AUDIT RIGHTS.</h1>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span> During the Term, Expert Choice may periodically require Client to complete a self-audit questionnaire in a form Expert Choice may provide. Expert Choice reserves the right to require an on-site audit of Client's usage of the desktop and/or hosted versions of the Software licensed by Client. Audits will be limited to license files containing project manager metadata that reports number of models and frequency of usage. Decision models, data inputs and participant data are exempted from audit. Any audits will be conducted during regular business hours, and Client agrees to permit Expert Choice and its representatives reasonable access to the premises, facilities, data, and networks necessary to conduct such audits. Expert Choice will use reasonable efforts not to interfere unduly with Client's regular business activities.</span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span> If an onsite auditor or self-audit reveals unauthorized use of any version of the Software and underpaid fees in excess of five percent (5%): (i) Client will reimburse Expert Choice for the costs incurred in connection with the audit; and (ii) Client will promptly pay to Expert Choice (at Expert Choice's then-standard rates) additional license fees sufficient to cover the unauthorized use revealed by the audit; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit Expert Choice's right, in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11. </span></p>
<h1>25. SURVIVAL.</h1>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span>The provisions of this Section 25 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, and 27 shall survive termination or expiration of this EULA for any reason.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1>26. NOTICE.</h1>

If any provision of this EULA is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect the invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision shall <span><span>be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term.</span></span></span></p>
