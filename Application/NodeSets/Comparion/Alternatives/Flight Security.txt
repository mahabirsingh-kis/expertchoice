#ALTERNATIVES
Redesign Transponders	Transponder redesign requires securing the entity to ensure it cannot be turned off deliberately by terrorists and that the unit works in conjunction with refinements made at the ground level at the airports.
Remote Flight Controls	Remote flight control of airbourne aircraft is similar to technologies used by NASA to send signals to the Space Shuttle, satellites and other space vehicles while in orbit.  These signals are used to control flight and affect many characteristics of the space vehicle performance.        The concept is a theoretical extension of known technologies with wide-ranging ramifications in regard to research, design and development costs, deployment and installation costs plus the actual installation impact and any associated on-going maintenance of affected systems.
Reinforced Cockpit Doors	Requires the reengineering and structural modification of all cockpit doors on exisiting and deployed aircraft as used by commercial airlines.  Reengineering requires the latching and barring of the cockpit door  from the cockpit side only.  Also, initially provides for the reinforcement of the material used for the cockpit door.  Original equipment manufacturers will incorporate better materials and locking mechanisms into new aircraft production.
Evasive Pilot Action	Evasive pilot action includes those airbourne maneuvers used to throw hi-jackers and terrorists off guard and to destablize the potential seizure of the aircraft.  Evasive pilot actions may include sudden loss of altitude, power diving the aircraft,  or high risk turns at significantly higher G forces including potential blackout.  May be used in conjunction with the loss of pressurization alternative.  Considered a counter-terrorist measure.
Pressurization Loss	Intentional cabin pressurization loss includes intended blackout of passengers and terrorists while oxygen remains available for cockpit crew (i.e., pilots and navigator, if available).  Considered a high risk counter-terrorist measure.
Solid Cockpit Bulkhead	Solid cockpit bulkhead requires the complete reengineering of  the access to the cockpit from the outside of the aircraft only and places a completely solid bulkhead across the fuselage to separate the cockpit permanently from the remainder of the aircraft.  Access to the cockpit would only be from outside (hence, while the aircraft is on the ground and never in flight).
Air Marshals	Incorporates the deployment and use of trained and armed Federal air marshals on selected domestic flights and all international and inter-continental flights originating in the United States and selected foreign countries for return flights.
Train Flight Crew	Includes the development and deployment of a comprehensive training program for all airline personnel and flight crews delineating all measures in regard to handling hi-jacking attempts, and counter-terrorist measures.
Train Security Checkpoint Personnel	Includes the qualification training and retraining certification of airport security personnel at all domestic airports in the United States.  Includes methods for spotting potential security risks and improved baggage screening measures.
Arming Pilots/Crew	Includes the complete training and arming of flight crews (namely the pilot and co-pilot, and navigator, as available as on selected widebodies, et al) to preclude loss of control of the cockpit to terrorists.
Stun Guns	Implement the use of stun guns through formal training applications at each airline and to train all affected cabin crews in the proper use of stun guns.        Note:  This is intended primarily for the Flight Attendants and not for the cockpit crew.  The cockpit crew would be the second line of defense with additional stun gun equipment deployed in the cockpit.
Screen 100% checked luggage	Includes provisions to screen all checked luggage and other baggage 100% by most sophisticated screening and detection technologies available.  Includes all baggage currently put into the aircraft by means of containerization or loose baggage loaded by ramp.
No Carry-on Luggage	Reduce or prohibit the practice of allowing carry-on luggage from entering the aircraft main deck and cabin.          Reduced would allow one piece of small luggage plus a purse, handbag or briefcase.        A prohibition would allow only for a purse or a briefcase only with no unchecked luggage or garment bags.
