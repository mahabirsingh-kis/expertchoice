<!--This xml will be returned by the web service when data grid is requested
Xml has simple structure of objectives hierarchy, rating scales (if needed),
list of covering objectives, list of alternatives and actual cells-->

<DataGrid> <!--This will be the root element of the xml-->
  <Hierarchy>
    <!--"Node" nodes describe the structure of objectives hierarchy
    Hierarchical relationships between nodes are represented by nested nature of nodes -->
    <Node Name="Goal" ID="0"> <!--We only need node name and ID (we need ID to reference to it later)-->
      <Node Name="Obj1" ID="1" /><!--Of course, there can be many nested levels depending on the hierarchy structure-->
      <Node Name="Obj2" ID="2" />
      <Node Name="Obj3" ID="3" />
      <Node Name="Obj4" ID="4" />
    </Node>
  </Hierarchy>
  
  <!--Here we will describe ratings scales that are used in our model.
  There might be a situation when none of the covering objectives is using ratings measurement type.
  In this case this node will be empty-->
  <RatingScales>
  <!--There can be several RatingScale nodes, one for each rating scale-->
    <RatingScale Name="Default Rating Scale" ID="0"><!--We need a name of rating scale and ID to reference it-->
        <!--List of intensities-->
        <Intensity Name="Low" ID="0" Value="0.1"/>
        <Intensity Name="Medium" ID="1" Value="0.5"/>
        <Intensity Name="High" ID="2" Value="0.9"/>
    </RatingScale>
  </RatingScales>
  
  <!--We will have a separate list of covering objectives.
  We just name an ID of the node that is a covering objective, specify measurement type
  and depending on measurement type we will might some other attributes.
  Meaning of measurement types (MT):
  0 - Pairwise. No additional data (attributes) needed here
  1 - Ratings. In this case we put ScaleID which references to the rating scale defined before
  2 - Simple Utility Curve
  5 - Direct
  6 - Step Function
  7 - Advanced Utility Curve
  For items 2,5,6,7 we specify Xmin and Xmax
  IDs of measurement types are exactly the same as in ECCore
  
  IMPORTANT: If covering objective doesn't even have a MT attribute this means 
  that we cannot measure any of the alternatives with respect to this covering objectives.
  This can be either because of alternatives contribution, user permissions or data instances.
  So, this way we don't need to pass any cells information for this covering objectives 
  and just make the whole column in the Data Grid disabled for entering values and grey it out.-->
  <CoveringObjectives>
    <CovObj ID="1" MT="0"/>
    <CovObj ID="2" MT="1" ScaleID="0"/>
    <CovObj ID="3" MT="2"/>
    <CovObj ID="3"/>
  </CoveringObjectives>
  
  <!--For alternatives we need only name and ID-->
  <Alternatives>
    <Alt Name="Alt1" ID="0"/>
    <Alt Name="Alt2" ID="1"/>
    <Alt Name="Alt3" ID="2"/>
  </Alternatives>
  
<!--Here we will pass the information about each allowed cells.
We will NOT pass information on cells that are restricted for some reason (alts contribution, permissions).
This way we will minimize the amount of data sent. All cells for which we didn't receive information 
we consider restricted and will disabled for entering judgments and will grey out in the Data Grid-->  
  <Cells>
    <Cell ObjID="2" AltID="0" Value="1"/> <!--For ratings we will pass intensity ID-->
    <Cell ObjID="2" AltID="1" Value="3"/>
    <Cell ObjID="3" AltID="0" Value=""/> <!--Blank Value means that there's no judgment yet-->
    <Cell ObjID="3" AltID="1" Value="0.5"/><!--For CovObjs that are not pw and not ratings, we just specify single value-->
    <Cell ObjID="3" AltID="2" Value="0.8"/>
  </Cells>
