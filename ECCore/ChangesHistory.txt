	Fixed case 888: duplicate alternatives in overall results
'C0096
	Added support for new alternative evaluation mode in the core - One at a Time WRT Alt
'C0097

	Note: this code is commented out for now, will uncomment once db changes are done
	IMPORTANT: v.1.1.4 differs from v.1.1.3 only in PipeMessages table structure: there's one field Added - MessageKind, to support Spyron surveys in pipe
    This is why there's no need to implement new StorageReader and StorageWriter classes versions _v_1_1_4,
    because this stuff is loaded from CanvasModule/clsPipeMessages and project db version checks are performed there

	Lot of changes.
'C0178
	Fixed DeleteCalculatedWeights function.
'C0179
	Fixed BugID: 1088 - RTE when saving non-pairwise data to ahp-file.
	The reason was that I added UsersNumber field to this table in Canvas, but didn't add the same in ahp-file. So, the fix is just adding this field in ahp-file.

'C0217
	Fixed some bugs with optimization (but not fully, to be continued in 'C0219)
'C0218
	Fixed bug with disabling alternatives (not loading them after returning to the model)
	NOTE: there's no need to set disabled nodes again, just open up the model and you will see them
'C0219
	Fixed BugID: 1219 - RTE: 'Column 'NodeName' does not belong to table AltsPairwiseJudgments
'C0220
	Fixed many things in optimization logic. This improves speed in several cases and fixes many bugs where you had to hit recalculate button
	NOTE: there are still some changes to follow tomorrow, because there are still couple issues left here (too late right now to continue)

	Replaced all calls of oCommand.ExecuteScalar to DBExecuteScalar(ProviderType, oCommand)

'C0259

'C0268
	Implementation of reading pipe parameters from streams and everything related to it

'C0270
	Changes to SetUser function of clsProjectManager for streams approach
	(Need to fix LoadMissingUsers as well!)
'C0271
	Moved code from CanvasCore and Application to streams approach
	A lot of things added/fixed due to normal work of streams approach
	
	NOTE: Right now it seems that you can create a new model, upload ahpx/ahp models. Download is NOT implemented yet.
	All data for all users (judgments and permissions) is loaded on model load (LoadOnDemand=False).
	All calculations (combined as well) are performed on the fly, no calculated data (or combined judgments) is stored in the db
	
	I mentioned that on large models when switching users in the combo-box on global results screen it takes several seconds to switch.
	This is NOT due to some operations in the code, but due to tree view control rendering 
	(for large model that I was testing it took about 15 seconds to switch the user while it took only 3 seconds to calculate everything and generate data for viewing)
	
	No support yet for:
		- Team Time Not 
		- Infodocs 
		- UserDisabledNodes (for PlacesRated kind of stuff)
		- Download of models
	
	This is just the very first version of Comparion Core with streams approach, so there might be some other issues.

	Note: this bug does NOT appear (cannot appear by design) if OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED = False (this fix is for case of True)
'C0303
	Support for direct values for ratings measurement type:
	  - read from AHP

'C0371
	Implementation of:
	  - saving the whole model (all structure elements and all users data) to one stream
	  - restoring the whole model from one stream to CanvasStreamDatabase
	NOTES:
	1. During save to a single stream and restore from a single stream to CanvasStreamDatabase NOTHING is loaded into ECCore memory objects
	2. Save/restore functions are very flexible in terms of adding new structure types and new user data types. Almost nothing depends on that
'C0372
	Changes to CanvasWebService (CWS) to support streams approach in TeamTime
'C0373
	Changes to CanvasWebService (CWS) to support direct entries with keypads in TeamTime (in both ahpx and streams approached)

        If you want to enter just 1 then you'll have to enter "*1*"
'C0374

'C0400
	Another critical fix for model version control :)
'C0401

	Fix to showing combined local results when walking through the pipe
'C0403
	Rewrote the part (more correct (and faster) approach) where project owner making judgments for other people in TeamTime

'C0410
	Fixed RTEs when trying to calculate or save project as decision in Project Generator when Fill Judgments is not checked

	Removed unnecessary call to CalculateIndividual when saving project as decision
'C0411
	Fixed BugID #1528 - RTE when downloading empty model as ahpx
'C0412
	Changed the way we persist judgments in streams database: if there's no judgments at all for a user, we do not write the stream to the database
	This fixes BugID #1675 for new models
'C0413
	Fixed BugID #1665 - the page is still enabled in TeamTime even if user cannot make a judgments for alternative
'C0414
	Implemented functions to support retrieving information about default total judgments count (for node, for hierarchy) based on pipe parameters

'C0426
	Changes to preserving AHP tables
'C0427
	Fixes to preservation of RAconstraints AHP table
'C0428
	The problem was the following:
	RAconstraints table in AHP contains column called "value". This is reserved SQL word, so when the code is trying to create insert command using command builder for DataAdapter it crashes.
	
	The fix is the following:
	Before upload (when the file is on the server, just right before clsProjectManager will read the model from it) we rename field "value" to "value1". Then perform preservation.
	On download, after we filled all needed tables and restored all preserved AHP tables, right before giving the file to the client we rename field "value1" to "value"
'C0428

'C0784
	Preserving direct input judgments in ahp file (not lost after download/upload) - BugID #2903
	IMPORTANT NOTE: see comments to case 2903.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	Judgments are preserved, but since EC11.5 does not support direct input for non-covering objectives, you won't be able to see it in EC11.5
	And I cannot put normalized values in NodeInfo table as Anatoly described, because when we open model in EC11.5 after download, we recalculate and this erases everything that is put in NodeInfo table
	In any case this would be not so good approach to fill NodeInfo table from Comparion
	It would be much better to implement support for direct input for non-covering objectives in EC11.5.
	Or at least to have the ability to read normalized direct values from some place - I can create a separate table for it, so EC11.5 can look it up.
	
	Something like this:
	
	Table "DirectValues":
	PID as Integer (for instance, 2)
	ParentNodeID as String (for instance, "N1")
	NodeID as String (for instance, "N2")
	Value as Double (for instance, 0.4)
	
	This way EC11.5 can use these values as calculated local priorities for direct input non-covering objectives and show results, etc.
'C0785
	Additional saving direct input judgments for non-covering objectives in ahp file as ratios on main diagonal
	NOTE: original judgments are still stored in NonPairwiseData table, because it is not clear what will be if some judgments will be missing (so there's no ratios)
'C0785
	Combined input source for restricted nodes for individuals. Optional, by default set to False (use old calculations approach). BugID #2839.

-----------------------------------
NEED GUID ONLY FOR:
1. HierarchyID
2. NodeID
3. UserID
4. RatingID


1. Working with ahpx models:
   If (the model is old) Then:
	   a. read integer ID
	   b. create Guid ID for this integer ID
	   c. when saving the model write Guid ID to the db
   Else
       a. read integer ID
       b. read Guid ID
   End If
   
2. Working with streams models:
   
   Writing to streams:
   a. write both integer and Guid IDs to the stream
   b. when writing a reference to an object with ID use GuidID

   Reading from streams:
   a. read integer AND Guid IDs
   b. when reading something that is referencing GuidID and object with such GuidID doesn't exist, skip it (doesn't matter what integer ID it has)
   
3. Working in memory
   a. When creating new object with ID, create Guid ID as well
   b. Work with integer IDs everywhere in the code!
   
   
   
1. GetUserID function is used more than needed (CalculateWeights)





------------------------
1. Improve GetNodesBelow function - make it by UserID
